https://www.makeatx.com/ - "We founded MakeATX with the belief that having access to the proper equipment and workspace would not only allow us to make beautiful objects with our tools and our hands, but it would also allow us the possibility of making a modest living doing something we love. ¬†In 2011, we opened our doors to a select number of local designers and makers with similar ambitions, and we now run a thriving workspace full of like-minded members, sharing resources, techniques and ideas, providing not only jobs for our handful of employees, but also allowing other business owners to make a living making things. ¬†MakeATX serves as an incubator for both business and design innovation.¬†"
