To plan the next part of a project, we can use a big white Board and colorful sticky notes. We divide the board into three sections: 
- "To do," 
- "In progress,"
- "Done."

As a group, we talk about our Goals, Important Outcomes and Challenges. Then, what we talk about what we want to do next. We write down Ideas on the sticky notes, and put them in the "To do" section of the Board. We pick the most important things to work on first. We can use different colored sticky notes to show how important they are. 

We break the big ideas down into smaller steps that we can finish in one or two days, and write each step on its own sticky note. We put these sticky notes in the "To do" section, too.

As we work on each step, we move the sticky note to the "In progress" section. When we finish a step, we move the sticky note to the "Done" section.

We keep adding new steps as we go, and change things around if we need to. By doing this, we can keep track of what we're doing and make sure we're all working together towards the same goal.
